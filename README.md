# lin-alg-studio
A desktop calculator for all things linear algebra and machine learning.

## Project Overview

This is a project I am working on alongside relearning Linear Algebra. It is being used to help reinforce core concepts that are required for Machine Learning and AI algorithms/concepts. However, the end goal is to have a fully functioning desktop application and editor that can be used for basic linear algebra calculations as well as to test ML/AI algorithms. Think R Studio but for Python.

Sections of this repo will also be available as standalone libraries, and they will be used in ML libraries that will follow this project.
